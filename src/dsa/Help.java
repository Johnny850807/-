     * To start your data structure and algorithm journey, do the following
     * 1. Create your onw directory with your name
     *
     * 2. Create your implementation classes of interfaces you want to practice (Sorter, ArrayStack, Compiler, BasicRecursive, ...).
     *
     * Each algorithm interface contains a family of similar algorithm methods,
     * ADT abstract classes are all abstract data structures
     *
     * 3. After finish your implementation classes, say, if you want to test your own Sorter, go to SortersTest class
     * and replace the instance of sorter with yours own sorter, and then right click the test class and set run.
     *
     * 4. If you want to test your Adts, first create your implementation of AdtFactory, specify your own Adts as return
     * instance of each overriding method. Then Go to AdtTest and replace the AdtFactory instance with yours.
